Project 

For my project I will estimate Facebook stock price using a model called Risdual Income.It's a widley used model both in acedemia and in the the investment industry.
There are many tools that we learned in class that are going to assist me with completing this research. I will be using the Captial Asset Pricing Model which uses regression analsysis to estimate the requered rate of return of for this stock.
I will also be examining correlation patterns for the stock price compared to other peer competetors to see how would this investment fit in a portifilio heavily wiaghted on tech stocks. 
I will also use the twittter sintiment analysis model that we learned in class to imporve my stock price estimation. 
Finally, I will compare my estimation with other analyst opinions. 



I will scrap most of my data from the yahoo finance. So, the yahoo finance module that we used in class will be very handy when I exracting Facebook's stock price.
Yahoo finance will also be my resource for my accounting data.Using the twitter API and teqniques we learned in class I will scrape analysts opinions to do my sentiment analysis.
